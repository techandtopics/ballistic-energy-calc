	 <string name="about_content">This application calculates the Taylor KO Factor and 
        the muzzle energy for a projectile. The muzzle energy is calculated using the
         firearms industry\'s standard formula. The Taylor KO Factor is a number greater
          than zero to determine the knock-down power of a projectile. The Taylor KO is 
          calculated using an equation designed by John Taylor to compare the effectiveness 
          of firearm rounds based on mass, velocity, and diameter of the projectile.

     <string name="help_content">Enter: the mass of the projectile as an integer in grains, 
        the velocity as an integer in feet per second, and the diameter in inches as a 
        decimal (.223, .308, etc). The muzzle energy is output in foot-pounds.</string>
        
     <string name="error_content">Please input values for velocity and mass. The default 
        values are hint text and are not supposed to be computed. Diameter must be entered 
        to have an accurate KO result. More help can be accessed through the menu button.</string>
